## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Data Visualization**

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Churn prediction using Random Forest  
4. Model evaluation and accuracy  
5. Feature importance visualization  
6. Customer segmentation: Loyal, At Risk, Uncertain
